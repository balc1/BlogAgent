# BlogAgent
Are you tired of slow, generic AI content? I will leverage cutting-edge technology to build and deploy a custom, high-speed AI Content Generation Agent tailored to your exact needs.

This agent isn't just a simple prompt. It's a sophisticated, multi-step workflow built with LangGraph (the latest framework for building stateful AI agents) and powered by Groq for near-instant content generation (using Llama 3.1).

What this agent can do (based on my portfolio project):

### Step 1: Title Generation: Creates a creative, SEO-friendly title based on your topic.

### Step 2: Content Generation: Writes a detailed, well-structured blog post in Markdown.

### Step 3: Translation & Routing: Automatically detects the target language (e.g., French, Hindi) and routes the content to a specialized translation node.

# The Technology Stack:

### AI Logic: LangGraph

### LLM: Groq (Llama 3.1 8b-Instant)

### Backend: FastAPI (Scalable, high-performance API)

### Frontend Demo: Streamlit (For you to test and approve the agent)

What You Will Get ): I will adapt this core agent to your business. Need different languages? A specific writing tone? Integration with your CMS (like WordPress)? Let's build it.
